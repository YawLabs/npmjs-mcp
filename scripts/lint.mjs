/**
 * Run biome against a binary that works on this host, at the version this repo
 * actually installs.
 *
 * Everywhere except Windows ARM64 this is a thin passthrough to the platform
 * binary npm installed. It exists because SOME biome releases ship a native
 * `@biomejs/cli-win32-arm64` build that crashes instead of running. Measured
 * on a Windows 11 ARM64 host: 2.5.4 exits 139 on every invocation path
 * (`npm run lint`, the `.bin/biome` shim, `npx biome`, and the .exe invoked
 * directly), while 2.4.16 and 2.5.13 run correctly there and report real
 * findings. The defect is per-RELEASE, not a permanent property of the
 * architecture -- earlier and later versions are healthy, and a future bump
 * may be too.
 *
 * That is what makes it dangerous in a release gate: a crash and a clean pass
 * both look like "the linter printed no findings", and which version you get
 * is whatever the lockfile pins. So on this host the script defaults to the
 * x64 build OF THE SAME VERSION, which runs correctly under Windows' x64
 * emulation and gives an authoritative result. `YAWLABS_BIOME_NATIVE=1` uses
 * the native arm64 binary instead, which is the right call once the installed
 * version is known good there.
 *
 * What is NOT wrong, so nobody re-diagnoses it from this file: `npm run` is
 * not implicated (a plain node script through the same wrapper exits 0), and
 * no invocation path "silently skips files" -- a healthy binary reports the
 * full checked-file count through npx, the shim and the direct .exe alike. A
 * broken binary crashes loudly; a working one works.
 *
 * Why this is a script and not a devDependency: npm refuses to install
 * `@biomejs/cli-win32-x64` on an arm64 host (EBADPLATFORM), which is precisely
 * the situation we are working around, so it cannot be declared normally. The
 * install below passes `--force` for that reason and `--no-save` so the
 * workaround never leaks into package.json.
 *
 * Why it matters here specifically: this repo has no CI. Its GitHub Actions
 * workflows were removed in b2c256c (#35), there is no .github/workflows
 * directory, and Actions is disabled on the repository, so there is no runner
 * to arbitrate formatting later. Whatever this script reports is the ONLY lint
 * signal that exists before `release.sh` publishes to npm from the workstation.
 *
 * Escape hatches, in case the platform assumption ages badly:
 *   YAWLABS_BIOME_BIN=<path>   use exactly this binary, skip all detection
 *   YAWLABS_BIOME_NATIVE=1     force the normal platform binary on any host
